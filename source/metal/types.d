/**
    The bounds for a subset of an object's elements.

    Metal has many object types that represent arrays of discrete elements. 
    For example, a texture has an array of pixel elements, and a thread grid has an array 
    of computational threads. Use MTLRegion instances to describe subsets of these objects.

    The origin is the front upper-left corner of the region, and its extents go towards the 
    back lower-right corner. Conceptually, when using a MTLRegion instance to describe a 
    subset of an object, treat the object as a 3D array of elements, even if it has fewer 
    dimensions. 
    
    For a 2D object, set the z coordinate of the origin to 0 and the depth to 1. 
    For a 1D object, set the y and z coordinates of the origin to 0 and the height and 
    depth to 1.
